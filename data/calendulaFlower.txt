Implemented a low cost Calendula flower classification system with Tensorflow, Android Studio and 
Arduino. The system used a deep convolutional neural network inception v3 trained with different 
Calendula flowers. When the system detected a Calendula flower, it sent a signal to an Arduino 
board and moved a servomotor to a specific point which allowed the correct classification of the 
flowers through a transportation band (Implemented in C, Python/Linux).
