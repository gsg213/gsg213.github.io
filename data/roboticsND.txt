Implementation of different robotics vision projects. These are based on the robotics
software engineer nanodegree provided by Udacity. All the projects were developed with ROS
and tested in a gazebo-based simulated environment. Different topics were addressed
such as Gazebo basic, ROS, robot localization, Mapping, SLAM, navigation and
path planning. The projects are listed below

    * How to use the model and building editor, plugins in Gazebo and more. 

    * Creating a ball chaser robot in ROS and Gazebo.

    * Localization through Kalman Filter, Monte Carlo methods and ACML.

    * Occupancy grid map generation, GridBased Fast Slam ROS paclage and RTAB-Map SLAM.

    * The A* algorithm and robot navigation.
