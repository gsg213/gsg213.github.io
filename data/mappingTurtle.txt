Equipping robotic systems with novel localization and navigation stacks is crucial for autonomous 
navigation. A localization and mapping system (laser-based SLAM) for a turtlebot2 in indoors was 
simulated. The system was capable to accurately localize the robot in a previously mapped 
environment and subsequently navigate to a specific position in an occupancy grid map (Implemented 
in C++/Linux)â€‹.
