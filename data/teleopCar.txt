Mathematical modelling of unmanned groundvehicles (UGV) is a well studied problem in robotics and 
essential for the control of a robot. Developed a teleoperation system for a car-like robot. The 
system received velocities in the local coordinate frame of the robot and through the inverse 
kinematics model of the vehicle these velocity commands were transformed to wheels’ speed and sent 
to the vehicle’s motors. This project was embedded in a Raspberry Pi3 to allow the remote control 
of the vehicle with a host computer through WIFI (Implemented in C/Linux).
