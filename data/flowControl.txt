Implemented a heat map generator based on computer vision techniques to stochastically estimate the 
most visited areas in an indoor space with a monocular camera. A feature tracker method was used to 
estimate the average flow of persons and a deep convolutional neural network was employed to obtain 
the segmentation of the floor in the scene. This information was merge together to â€‹gather relevant 
information about the people habits in shopping centers or crowded areas (Implemented in Python/
Linux)
