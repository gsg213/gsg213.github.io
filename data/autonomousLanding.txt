My BEng degree project addressed the problem of the autonomous landing of a UAV 
with a landing platform located on the top of a ground vehicle. The project 
utilized vision-based techniques to detect the landing platform, a Kalman 
filter was tailored for the tracking phase and finally, a PID controller sent 
control commands to the flight controller of the UAV to land properly on the 
platform. Rigorous assessments were conducted through the simulation of the 
whole robotic stack with ROS and gazebo in the software in the loop provided by 
PX4. Ultimately, the system was tested in a custom DJI F-450 and embedded in a 
Odroid XU4. The system demonstrates a satisfactory performance and was able to 
land with a mean error of ten centimeters from the center of the landing 
platform (Implemented in Python, C++/Linux).
